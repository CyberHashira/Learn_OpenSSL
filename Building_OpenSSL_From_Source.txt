Build OpenSSL from Source on Windows
-------------------------------------

Prerequisites :-
- Visual Studio (any version will do, latest if possible)

- Strawberry Perl 
  https://strawberryperl.com/

- Nasm (Netwide Assembler)
  https://www.nasm.us/
  
- Windows OS


Step 1) Download the source tar ball for OpenSSL from www.openssl.org
Step 2) Create a new folder anywhere on your Windows OS and extract the contents of tar ball into that folder.
Step 3) Launch Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt and go to the directory where the contents of extracted tarball exists.
Step 4) Configure Makefile using "perl configure VC-WIN64A --openssldir=C:\OpenSSL --prefix=C:\OpenSSL"
Step 5) Start the building process by executing "nmake".
Step 6) Install the binaries by executing the command "nmake install".
Step 7) Make sure the folder where the OpenSSL.exe exists is included in PATH environment variable.

Building OpenSSL from source on Linux
--------------------------------------


Prerequisites :-
- GCC compiler
- Perl



Step 1) Download the source tar ball of OpenSSL from www.openssl.org
Step 2) Create a new directory anywhere on linux and extract the contents of tarball into that directory.
Step 3) Execute ./configure to generate the Makefile.
Step 4) Execute "make" to start the build process. Optionally execute "make -j" if you want to build OpenSSL binaries faster.
Step 5) Execute "make install" to install the binaries.
