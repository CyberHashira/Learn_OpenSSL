# OpenSSL Samples

Updated : Aug-05-2023


These are some C++ sample codes which makes use of OpenSSL API. All these codes were tested using OpenSSL 3.0.9.

| Categories | Description                  |
|-----------:|------------------------------|
|   `legacy` | Legacy code samples **DEPRECATED** |
|  `engines` | Sample codes to load Engines **DEPRECATED** |
| `crypto_operation` | demonstrates crypto operations |
|      `evp` | Contains samples that uses OpenSSL EVP |
|     `misc` | Some uncategorized sample codes |




### Sample description -
+ Legacy - These are old functions that are now deprecated in OpenSSL 3.x. OpenSSL may eventually remove those functions. 

+ Engines - These are some samples codes that shows how to load engines and perform crypto using those engines. Engines are DEPRECATED.

+ Crypto Operations - These are samples codes that shows how to perform different kinds of crypto operations.

+ EVP - Also known as Envelop, OpenSSL recommends using OpenSSL EVP API as much as possible.

+ Misc - Contains code which I haven't categorized yet.
